									<h1>About</h1>
									<h3>Zac</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/zac.jpg" alt="" /></span>I completed bachelor’s degrees in Applied Mathematics and Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology at Humboldt State University in 2006 and began my career as a lab scientist. After working in various roles in industry as well as within academia, I decided that wielding a pipette was ultimately not a great passion of mine. After pursuing interests including traveling and learning Mandarin, I stumbled into the insurance industry. I gained valuable experience working as an insurance agent and financial advisor at two large insurance companies before becoming disillusioned by the prevalence of, what I consider to be, ethically dubious business practices and an overall spirit of ‘make money at all costs’. Perseverance ultimately paid off as I was able to leverage the knowledge I acquired to go into business for myself as an independent insurance broker. I am proud of the role I’ve been able to play in aiding my clients through the tumultuous waters of the insurance industry. While growing my practice, I have maintained my commitment to learning and self improvement. I have gained proficiency at computer programming and data science by working through increasingly more difficult certifications on the Coursera and edX online learning platforms. I am currently enrolled in a 14 month <em>microMasters</em> in Statistics and Data Science offered through MITx. While I aspire to be able to move seamlessly between languages and different technologies, I have focused much of my time on writing Python and working within Linux environments. I have more recently recommitted to a lifelong goal of becoming fluent in Mandarin and am excited to be able to test my knowledge with the TOCFL/HSK exam in the near future. Having a healthy lifestyle is also very important to me and I have found daily meditation and regular cardio to be invaluable tools in maintaining physical health as well as mental acuity.</p>
									<h3>Stella 'Goose'</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/stella.jpg" alt="" /></span>I completed my Puppy Education certificate at the tender age of 5 months where I finished second in my class – bested only by a clever Shiba Inu. Inspired by a podcast with Peter Thiel, I decided not to pursue an over priced university degree and, instead,  focused on becoming a self taught human companion. Unfortunately, I did not get selected for the Thiel Scholarship and I now work with Zac. I feel that my soft skills more than make up for any deficit I may have in more quantitative areas. My barking skills have been honed over the years by daily encounters with would be intruders. I can now hear the mailman from a block away and am proud to say they have yet to breach the front door. In addition to my verbal prowess, I am an exceptionally good listener. On a personal level, I enjoy walks in the park, chasing sticks and belly rubs. I have been told that I am a bit needy but I strongly believe that this is out weighed by commitment to unconditional love.</p>
